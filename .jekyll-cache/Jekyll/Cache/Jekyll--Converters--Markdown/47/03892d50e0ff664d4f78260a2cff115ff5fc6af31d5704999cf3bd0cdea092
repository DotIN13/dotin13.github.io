<p>What three things keep Barack Obama up at night?

<p>The former U.S. president says that neither nuclear weapons nor terrorists make the list.

<p>If those issues are not tackled soon, â€œwe could end up having even greater problems than we do today,â€ he told a sold-out audience in Singapore on Monday at an hour-long event, â€œIn Conversation with President Barack Obama.â€

<p>One worrying new trend is political polarization, both in advanced economies and in developing countries.

<p>â€œIf you ask me, probably the biggest trend that Iâ€™ve seen over the last decade is a return to some of the political trends and societal tensions that, you know, help lead to World War I and World War II,â€ said the 58-year-old former politician.

<p>Noting people his age and younger have lived during times of â€œrelative tranquility,â€ he recalled major events that resulted in â€œenormous optimismâ€ around the globe: the fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification of Europe, the prison release of South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, Chinese economic reform, globalization and a billion people lifted from poverty.

<p>Even after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S., there was still a sense that the event was an anomaly in a world that was becoming more integrated, better educated and more tolerant, he said.

<p>â€œEven as the standards of living were rising and it looked like a relatively tranquil time, under the surface there was enormous disruption,â€ Obama said. â€œAs a consequence of globalization, outsourcing, automation, blue-collar workers were losing jobs and status and felt as if their kids were not going to do as well as they were. There were winners and losers.â€

<p>â€œAnd, as a consequence, what you start seeing is this populist backlash â€” sometimes from the left, more often from the right â€” and a fallback to tribalism, racism, misogyny, ethnic or sectarian conflicts and strong men who would come in and oftentimes exploit some of those divisions.â€

<p>During the discussion, Obama also talked about what he misses about being president: the positive impact he could make, the intellectual challenge and his team. However, there are some things he doesnâ€™t miss about it, such as the security bubble, the â€œpomp and circumstanceâ€ of cameras, and people standing up when he walked into a room.
